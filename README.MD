#TacoTime

TacoTime allows users to gift authentic Mexican food to friends and strangers. Users are able to search nearby restaurants, click through to a restaurants profile page, see a map of where the restaurant is, and buy a meal through the TacoTime website. Users can put in the name and phone number of the intended recipient of the meal, and the recipient will get a text message to say someone has bought them a meal. Users can also buy a stranger a meal, as a charitable gift.
